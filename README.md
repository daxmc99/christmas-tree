# Menorah 
ASCII menorah with animations for 256 colored terminals (inspired by apolukhin/christmas-tree):

![Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daxmc99/menorah/docs/menorah.png)

(light are glowing in the terminal!)

# How to build and run:
In terminal run `g++-7 -O2 tree.cpp -std=c++17 -pthread && ./a.out menorah.txt`

# Fun
You can change the `menorah.txt` file and draw your own trees and decorate them in a way you like
